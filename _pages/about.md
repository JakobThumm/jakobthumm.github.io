title: About me
---
I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University in the [Autonomous Systems Lab](https://stanfordasl.github.io/) under supervision of [Marco Pavone](https://profiles.stanford.edu/marco-pavone).
Prior to joining Stanford, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from the Technical University of Munich, where I was supervised by [Matthias Althoff](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/en/cps/members/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff/).

My research enables robots to work together with humans in a safe, efficient, and enjoyable manner. 
These robots will support human workers in sectors such as manufacturing, health care, and geriatric care to fulfill tedious, strenuous, and dangerous tasks.
To achieve this, I develop safe, embodied, and personalized AI agents that are specialized for human environments.

Outside the lab, I am a passionate runner and volunteer at [Sutro Stewards](https://www.sutrostewards.org/), where I maintain hiking trails in the heart of San Francisco.
