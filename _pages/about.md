title: About me
---
I was born in Freiburg, Germany and always had a passion for understanding how machines work. This led me to pursue a degree in Mechatronics at the Karlsruher Institute of Technology where I gained valuable experience in machine learning through various student assistant positions.

My interest in making machines think smarter led me to specialize in safe human-robot collaboration for my graduate studies at the Technical University of Munich. I am currently a student at the Informatics department where I work in the Cyber-Physical-Systems group under the guidance of Matthias Althoff.

Throughout my academic journey, I have consistently challenged myself to learn new things and apply my knowledge in practical ways. I am always eager to work on projects that have the potential to make a positive impact on society.
