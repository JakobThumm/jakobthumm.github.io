I'm a Ph.D. student of Robotics at the [Technical University of Munich (TUM)](https://www.tum.de/) with the [Cyber-Physical Systems Group](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/home/). My goal is to train a safe and enjoyable robot co-worker. For this, my research questions are:
 - We let the robots out of their cages, what now?
 - How can we ensure safety for reinforcement learning agents (and other AI-agents) in human-robot environments?
 - How do we design our safety methods so that they interfere with the agent as little as possible while still being provably safe?
 - Can we teach a robot to dynamically react to human behavior, e.g., evade the human?
 - What is needed to create a robot that humans like to work with?
 - What could be fun ways to teach reinforcement learning in robotics?
